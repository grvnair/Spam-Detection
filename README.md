Spam Detector (Dataset source: UCI Machine Learning Repository)

1. Built a spam detector model using the Bernoulli Naïve Bayes algorithm which achieved the accuracy of 97%.
2. Visualized the most used spam and ham words using the Wordcloud library.
3. Performed stemming to reduce the words to its word stem using Porter Stemmer.
4. Performed feature extraction by converting the texts into vectors using Count Vectorizer.
5. Compared the accuracy score of Gaussian, Multinomial and Bernoulli Naïve Bayes algorithms.
